## 1.3 Enhancement Scope Definition

### Enhancement Type
✅ **New Feature Addition** (Primary)
✅ **Integration with New Systems** (Secondary - public portal for warranty verification)
- Not checked: Major Feature Modification, Performance/Scalability, UI/UX Overhaul, Stack Upgrade

### Enhancement Description

**Phase 2** transforms the Service Center from basic ticket tracking into a **comprehensive service management platform** by adding:

1. **Task-Based Workflow Management**: Structured, template-driven workflows with pre-defined task sequences for different service types (warranty, paid repair, replacement)
2. **Warranty Service Support**: Serial number verification, warranty tracking (manufacturer + company), RMA workflows
3. **Warehouse Management**: Two-tier architecture (Physical warehouses → Virtual warehouses) with physical product tracking and serial number management

### Impact Assessment

✅ **Moderate to Significant Impact** (some existing code changes + new modules)

**Breakdown:**
- **Database Impact**: Significant - 8+ new tables (task templates, task instances, physical products, warehouses, serial numbers, warranty records, RMA requests, service requests)
- **API Impact**: Significant - 4+ new tRPC routers (workflow, warranty, warehouse, service-request)
- **Frontend Impact**: Moderate - New pages/components, but follows existing patterns
- **Existing Code Impact**: Minimal - Service ticket flow remains intact, enhancement is additive
- **RLS Impact**: Significant - New RLS policies for all new tables

## 1.4 Goals and Background Context

### Goals

- **G1**: Reduce service errors by 40% through structured task workflows with mandatory checklists
- **G2**: Accelerate technician onboarding by 50% through standardized task templates
- **G3**: Achieve 95% warranty verification accuracy through serial number validation
- **G4**: Reduce inventory stockouts by 60% through warehouse management and low-stock alerts
- **G5**: Enable public-facing service request portal for warranty verification without authentication
- **G6**: Provide granular task-level progress visibility for managers
- **G7**: Establish RMA workflow for product replacements and warranty claims

### Background Context

The Service Center application has successfully deployed Phase 1 and achieved strong adoption across all user roles (Admin, Manager, Technician, Reception). The existing system provides solid ticket management fundamentals but lacks three critical capabilities needed for scaling operations:

**Why This Enhancement Is Needed:**

1. **Operational Inefficiency**: Technicians rely on implicit knowledge of service procedures. Estimated 30% skip critical verification steps, leading to service quality inconsistencies and errors.

2. **Warranty Management Gap**: ~15% of warranty claims require rework due to eligibility verification issues. No upfront verification means accepting non-warranty items, causing customer dissatisfaction and lost revenue.

3. **Inventory Visibility**: No distinction between warranty stock, RMA staging, and dead stock. Managers spend 2-3 hours weekly manually tracking inventory. Frequent stockouts on critical warranty replacements.

4. **Business Growth**: 40% growth in warranty claim volume (Q4 2024), 3 new technicians onboarded (Q1 2025). Existing brownfield foundation (architecture, database, auth) is ready for enhancement.

**How It Fits the Existing Project:**

This enhancement builds **additively** on the existing brownfield architecture. The service ticket lifecycle (`pending → in_progress → completed`) remains intact. Phase 2 adds:
- Task execution layer **within** existing ticket workflow
- Warranty verification layer **before** ticket creation
- Warehouse management **parallel** to existing parts inventory

All new modules integrate with existing tRPC architecture, Supabase RLS model, and Next.js App Router patterns.
