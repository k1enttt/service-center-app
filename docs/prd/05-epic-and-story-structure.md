# 5. Epic and Story Structure

## 5.1 Epic Approach

**Epic Structure Decision:** **Single comprehensive epic** with logically sequenced stories

**Rationale:**
- All three modules (Task Workflow, Warranty/Warehouse, Service Request) are interconnected and build on the same foundation
- Splitting into separate epics would create artificial dependencies and delay integration testing
- Brownfield enhancement benefits from unified implementation approach to maintain system consistency
- Single epic allows for holistic testing of the complete service lifecycle

**Epic Goal:**
Transform Service Center from basic ticket tracking to comprehensive service management platform with task-based workflows, warranty verification, physical product tracking, and customer self-service portal.

**Integration Requirements:**
- Warehouse integration requires task workflow (warehouse OUT task when replacement approved)
- Service request portal requires serial verification which depends on physical products database
- Task workflow execution updates warehouse locations (product movements tied to tasks)
- All modules share existing service_tickets as integration point

**Story Sequencing Strategy (Risk-Minimizing Approach):**
1. **Security Foundation**: RBAC implementation (Story 01.00)
2. **Foundation First**: Database schema and core data models
3. **Backend Before Frontend**: tRPC procedures before UI components
4. **Internal Before Public**: Staff-facing features before customer portal
5. **Incremental Integration**: Each story adds value while maintaining existing functionality
6. **Testing Checkpoints**: Verification that existing ticket workflow still works after each major story
