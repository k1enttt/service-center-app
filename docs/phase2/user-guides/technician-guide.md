## Task Execution Workflow

### Understanding Task Status Flow
Tasks follow this lifecycle:
```
Pending ‚Üí In Progress ‚Üí Completed
            ‚Üì
         Blocked
```

**Status Definitions:**
- **Pending (Ch·ªù x·ª≠ l√Ω):** Task assigned but not started
- **In Progress (ƒêang x·ª≠ l√Ω):** Task actively being worked on
- **Completed (Ho√†n th√†nh):** Task finished with completion notes
- **Blocked (B·ªã ch·∫∑n):** Task cannot proceed due to issues (missing parts, equipment failure, etc.)

### Starting a Task

**Step 1: Locate Your Task**
1. Go to "My Tasks" page
2. Find the ticket you're working on
3. Locate the task in the sequence

**Step 2: Click "B·∫Øt ƒë·∫ßu c√¥ng vi·ªác" (Start Task)**
- Button appears for tasks in "Pending" status
- Task immediately changes to "In Progress"
- System records the start time automatically
- If this is the first task on a pending ticket, the ticket automatically advances to "In Progress" status

**Important Notes:**
- You can only start tasks if no blockers are present
- In strict sequence mode, you may need to complete previous tasks first (see lock icon)
- Starting a task signals to managers that you're actively working on it

### Completing a Task

**Step 1: Finish the Work**
Complete the actual repair or service work according to task requirements.

**Step 2: Click "Ho√†n th√†nh" (Complete)**
The completion modal will open.

**Step 3: Enter Completion Notes** (REQUIRED)
- Minimum 5 characters required
- Describe what you did:
  - Actions taken
  - Results achieved
  - Issues encountered and resolved
  - Parts used (if any)
  - Test results

**Good Example:**
```
Replaced cracked LCD screen with new OEM part (Serial: LCD-2025-1234).
Tested display functionality - all pixels working.
Touchscreen calibrated and responsive.
Applied new protective film.
```

**Bad Example:**
```
Done
```

**Step 4: Handle Warnings (Flexible Mode Only)**
If the template is in flexible mode and you're completing tasks out of order:
- A warning alert will appear showing incomplete previous tasks
- Review the warning to ensure this is intentional
- Proceed with completion

**Step 5: Click "Ho√†n th√†nh c√¥ng vi·ªác"**
- Task marked as completed
- Completion notes saved to task history
- System records completion time
- If this is the last task on the ticket, the ticket automatically changes to "Completed" status

### Blocking a Task

**When to Block a Task:**
Block a task when you cannot proceed due to:
- Missing parts or components
- Defective replacement parts
- Equipment or tool unavailable
- Customer approval needed
- Technical issue beyond your capability
- Safety concerns

**How to Block:**
1. Click "B·ªã ch·∫∑n" (Block) button on an in-progress task
2. Task status changes to "Blocked"
3. Add a comment explaining the blocker (see Comments section)

**Important:**
- Always document WHY you blocked the task in comments
- Notify your manager immediately about blocked tasks
- Include what's needed to unblock (e.g., "Need part #ABC-123")

**Unblocking:**
Once the blocker is resolved:
1. Click "Ti·∫øp t·ª•c c√¥ng vi·ªác" (Continue Task)
2. Task returns to "In Progress" status
3. Continue working normally

## Dynamic Template Switching

### What is Template Switching?
Sometimes, initial diagnosis reveals a different problem than reported. Template switching allows you to change the task workflow mid-service to match the actual issue discovered.

**Story 1.17 Feature**

### When to Switch Templates

**Common Scenarios:**
1. **Initial Report:** "Phone won't turn on" (Software diagnosis template)
   **Actual Issue:** Cracked screen preventing boot (Screen replacement template)

2. **Initial Report:** "Laptop running slow" (Software maintenance template)
   **Actual Issue:** Hard drive failure (Hardware replacement template)

3. **Initial Report:** "Water damage" (Standard repair template)
   **Actual Issue:** Too extensive, needs replacement (Replacement template)

### How to Switch Templates

**Prerequisites:**
- You must be viewing the ticket detail page
- Ticket must NOT be completed or cancelled
- You should have diagnostic evidence of the different issue

**Step-by-Step Process:**

**Step 1: Open Ticket Detail**
1. From My Tasks, click the ticket number
2. Ticket detail page opens

**Step 2: Click "ƒê·ªïi Template" (Switch Template)**
- Button located in top-right ticket actions area
- Only visible to Technicians and Managers
- Only appears if ticket has a current template

**Step 3: Review Current Template**
- Modal opens showing current template name
- A blue info alert displays the current template

**Step 4: Read the Warning**
The red warning alert explains what happens:
- ‚úÖ **Preserved:** Completed and in-progress tasks stay
- ‚ùå **Removed:** Pending and blocked tasks are deleted
- ‚ûï **Added:** New tasks from selected template are added
- üìù **Logged:** Change recorded in audit history

**Step 5: Select New Template**
1. Click the "Ch·ªçn Template m·ªõi" dropdown
2. Browse available templates (current template excluded)
3. Select the appropriate template for the actual issue
4. Templates show service type badge (Warranty/Paid/Replacement)

**Step 6: Preview New Tasks**
- Preview box shows all tasks from the new template
- Each task displays:
  - Sequence number (#1, #2, #3...)
  - Task name
  - Custom instructions (if any)
  - Required/Optional badge
- Scroll through the preview to verify
- Total task count shown at bottom

**Step 7: Enter Reason** (REQUIRED)
- Minimum 10 characters required
- Be specific about why you're switching:
  - What you discovered during diagnosis
  - Why original template doesn't apply
  - What the actual issue is

**Good Example:**
```
Sau khi ch·∫©n ƒëo√°n, ph√°t hi·ªán m√†n h√¨nh b·ªã v·ª° ho√†n to√†n do r∆°i,
kh√¥ng ph·∫£i l·ªói ph·∫ßn m·ªÅm nh∆∞ b√°o c√°o ban ƒë·∫ßu. C·∫ßn thay th·∫ø m√†n h√¨nh.
```

**Step 8: Confirm Switch**
- Click "X√°c nh·∫≠n chuy·ªÉn ƒë·ªïi" (Confirm Switch)
- System processes the change:
  - Preserves your completed work
  - Removes pending tasks
  - Adds new template tasks
  - Logs the change with your reason
  - Notifies manager

**Step 9: Continue Working**
- Modal closes
- Ticket now uses new template
- Continue with new task sequence
- Your completed work is preserved

### What Happens Behind the Scenes

**Preserved Data:**
- All completed tasks remain in history
- All in-progress tasks continue unchanged
- Task completion notes are kept
- Time tracking continues

**Changed Data:**
- Pending tasks removed (not started yet)
- Blocked tasks removed (blockers likely irrelevant to new workflow)
- New tasks added from new template
- Template reference updated

**Audit Trail:**
- Template change logged with timestamp
- Your reason recorded
- Old and new template names stored
- Manager receives notification

### Important Notes
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Cannot undo:** Template switches are permanent
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Choose carefully:** Review preview before confirming
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Document well:** Your reason helps future analysis
- ‚úÖ **Work preserved:** Completed tasks are never lost
- üîî **Manager notified:** Changes are transparent

## Task Sequence Modes

### Overview
Templates can be configured in two modes that control how strictly you must follow task order.

### Strict Mode (Default)

**How It Works:**
- Tasks MUST be completed in order
- You cannot skip ahead
- Locked tasks show a üîí lock icon
- Complete button is disabled on locked tasks

**Visual Indicators:**
- Lock icon next to task name
- Tooltip shows which tasks must be completed first
- Complete button is grayed out with tooltip

**Example:**
```
‚úÖ #1 Customer Check-in (Completed)
‚úÖ #2 Visual Inspection (Completed)
üîí #3 Diagnosis (Locked - Complete task #2 first)
üîí #4 Repair (Locked)
```

**When Locked:**
1. Hover over lock icon to see prerequisites
2. Complete previous tasks first
3. Lock automatically releases when prerequisites done
4. No warnings or confirmations needed

### Flexible Mode

**How It Works:**
- Tasks CAN be completed in any order
- System shows warnings but doesn't block
- Warning icon (‚ö†Ô∏è) appears when completing out of order
- Manager decided this template allows flexibility

**Visual Indicators:**
- Warning icon next to task name
- Orange/yellow color scheme
- Completion modal shows warning alert

**Example:**
```
‚úÖ #1 Customer Check-in (Completed)
‚ùå #2 Visual Inspection (Pending)
‚ö†Ô∏è #3 Diagnosis (Warning - #2 not complete)
‚ùå #4 Repair (Pending)
```

**When Completing Out of Order:**
1. Click "Ho√†n th√†nh" on task #3 (for example)
2. Warning alert appears in completion modal:
   - "C·∫£nh b√°o: Ho√†n th√†nh kh√¥ng theo th·ª© t·ª±"
   - Lists incomplete previous tasks
   - Explains flexible mode allows this
3. Enter completion notes as normal
4. Click "Ho√†n th√†nh c√¥ng vi·ªác"
5. Task completes successfully

**Why Use Flexible Mode:**
- Some workflows are naturally parallel
- Experienced technicians may optimize order
- Certain tasks don't depend on previous ones
- Manager trusts technician judgment

### How to Tell Which Mode?
- **Strict Mode:** Look for lock icons on pending tasks
- **Flexible Mode:** Look for warning icons when appropriate
- Ask your manager if unclear
- Template settings determine the mode

## Product Handling

### Physical Product Tracking
When working on service tickets, you may need to handle physical products with serial numbers.

### Checking Product Serial Numbers

**During Check-In:**
1. Locate product serial number on device
   - Usually on back, bottom, or battery compartment
   - May be on original packaging
2. Verify serial matches what's recorded in system
3. Report any mismatches immediately to reception/manager

**Common Locations for Serial Numbers:**
- Laptops: Bottom panel or battery compartment
- Phones: Settings > About or SIM tray
- Tablets: Back panel or Settings
- Accessories: Product label or packaging

### Recording Product Condition

**Initial Inspection:**
- Document any existing damage (scratches, dents, cracks)
- Take photos if necessary
- Note in task completion notes
- This protects both you and the customer

**Example Inspection Note:**
```
Initial condition: Minor scratches on back cover, screen intact,
no water damage indicators. Camera functioning normally.
```

**After Repair:**
- Note final condition
- Document any cosmetic changes
- List new parts installed with serial numbers

### Automatic Warehouse Movements

**What Happens Automatically:**
When you work on tickets with physical products, the system tracks:

**Check-In Flow:**
- Product enters "Service In Progress" virtual warehouse
- Location tracked by ticket number
- System knows exactly where product is

**Check-Out Flow:**
- Product moves to "Ready for Pickup" when ticket completes
- Customer notified automatically
- Warehouse staff knows product location

**Replacement Flow:**
- Failed product moves to "RMA Queue"
- Replacement product issued from "Available Stock"
- Serial numbers tracked for warranty

**What You Need to Do:**
- Ensure product serial number is recorded correctly
- Complete tasks accurately (triggers movements)
- Report any product handling issues immediately

### Best Practices
- ‚úÖ Always verify serial numbers match
- ‚úÖ Handle products carefully to avoid additional damage
- ‚úÖ Document existing damage before starting work
- ‚úÖ Keep products in designated service area
- ‚úÖ Never release products without manager approval
- ‚ùå Don't skip serial number verification
- ‚ùå Don't work on products not assigned to you

### Time Management

**Prioritize:**
1. Blocked tasks that are now unblocked
2. Tickets nearing SLA deadline
3. In-progress tasks (finish before starting new)
4. High-priority tickets (marked by manager)

**Batch Similar Tasks:**
- If you have multiple screen replacements, do them together
- Reduces tool setup/cleanup time
- More efficient workflow

**Communicate Delays:**
- If task takes longer than estimated, update manager
- Add comment explaining why
- Better to communicate early than miss deadlines

### Template Switching Tips

**When NOT to Switch:**
- If you're almost done with current template
- If issue is minor and can be handled within current workflow
- If you're unsure - ask manager first

**When TO Switch:**
- Issue discovered is completely different
- Current template would waste time on irrelevant tasks
- New template significantly better matches actual issue

**Always:**
- Write detailed reason (helps future analysis)
- Double-check template preview
- Complete diagnostic tasks before switching

### Quality Assurance

**Before Marking Complete:**
- ‚úÖ Test the repair thoroughly
- ‚úÖ Verify all functions work
- ‚úÖ Clean the device
- ‚úÖ Check all screws/panels are secure
- ‚úÖ Verify serial numbers match

## Troubleshooting

### Cannot Start a Task

**Issue:** "Start Task" button is grayed out or missing

**Possible Causes:**
1. **Task is locked (strict mode):** Complete previous tasks first
   - Look for lock icon
   - Hover to see which tasks are needed
2. **Task already in progress or completed:** Check status badge
3. **Task assigned to someone else:** Verify it's actually assigned to you
4. **Ticket is completed/cancelled:** Cannot start tasks on finished tickets

**Solution:**
- Complete prerequisites first
- Ask manager to reassign if needed
- Refresh page if status looks wrong

### Cannot Complete a Task

**Issue:** "Complete" button is disabled

**Possible Causes:**
1. **Task is locked (strict mode):** Complete previous tasks
2. **Task not in "In Progress" status:** Must start task first
3. **Template in strict mode with incomplete prerequisites**

**Solution:**
- Hover over disabled button for tooltip explanation
- Complete previous tasks
- Ask manager about template sequence mode

### Completion Notes Validation Error

**Issue:** "Ghi ch√∫ ho√†n th√†nh ph·∫£i c√≥ √≠t nh·∫•t 5 k√Ω t·ª±"

**Cause:** Your notes are too short (less than 5 characters)

**Solution:**
- Write meaningful completion notes
- Describe what you did, results achieved, tests performed
- Minimum 5 characters, but should be much longer for quality

### Template Switch Button Missing

**Issue:** Cannot find "ƒê·ªïi Template" button

**Possible Causes:**
1. **Ticket already completed/cancelled:** Cannot switch finished tickets
2. **Ticket has no template:** Nothing to switch from
3. **Not on ticket detail page:** Button only shows on detail view

**Solution:**
- Check ticket status
- Verify ticket was created with a template
- Navigate to full ticket detail page (not just My Tasks)

### Task Not Appearing in My Tasks

**Issue:** Manager says task is assigned but you don't see it

**Possible Causes:**
1. **Page not refreshed:** Tasks auto-refresh every 30 seconds
2. **Task on different ticket:** Check all ticket groups
3. **Filter applied:** Check if you have any filters enabled
4. **Assignment to wrong user:** Manager assigned to someone else by mistake

**Solution:**
- Wait 30 seconds for auto-refresh or refresh page manually
- Scroll through all ticket groups
- Ask manager to verify assignment

### System Shows Wrong Task Status

**Issue:** Status doesn't match what you see

**Possible Causes:**
1. **Cache issue:** Browser showing old data
2. **Concurrent update:** Someone else updated the task
3. **Network delay:** Update not synced yet

**Solution:**
- Refresh the page
- Wait 30 seconds for auto-refresh
- Check with manager if discrepancy persists

## FAQ

### General Questions

**Q: How often do my tasks refresh automatically?**
A: Every 30 seconds. The My Tasks page automatically polls for updates.

**Q: Can I work on multiple tasks at the same time?**
A: Technically yes, but best practice is to focus on one task at a time. Only start a task when you're actively working on it for accurate time tracking.

**Q: What happens if I start a task but get interrupted?**
A: The task stays "In Progress" until you complete it. If you're interrupted for a long time, add a comment explaining the delay.

**Q: Can I see tasks assigned to other technicians?**
A: No, My Tasks only shows YOUR assigned tasks. Managers can see all tasks.

### Task Execution Questions

**Q: What's the minimum length for completion notes?**
A: 5 characters, but you should write much more detailed notes for quality and warranty purposes.

**Q: Can I edit completion notes after submitting?**
A: No, completion notes cannot be edited once submitted. Double-check before clicking "Ho√†n th√†nh c√¥ng vi·ªác."

**Q: What if I accidentally completed the wrong task?**
A: Contact your manager immediately. They may need to adjust the record or create a corrective ticket.

**Q: Can I skip a task?**
A: Not by yourself. If a task is not needed, ask your manager to skip it. Managers can mark tasks as "Skipped."

**Q: What does the "actual duration" field mean?**
A: It's automatically calculated from start time to completion time. Helps track how long tasks really take.

### Template Switching Questions

**Q: Can I switch templates multiple times on one ticket?**
A: Yes, but avoid excessive switching. Each switch is logged and reviewed.

**Q: What happens to tasks I already completed when I switch?**
A: They're preserved. Completed and in-progress tasks always stay.

**Q: Can I switch back to the original template?**
A: Yes, but you'll need to go through the same process. Previously removed tasks don't come back.

**Q: Do I need manager approval to switch templates?**
A: No, but managers are notified automatically. If unsure, ask before switching.

**Q: What if the new template has a task I already completed manually?**
A: The system adds it anyway. You can mark it as complete again with a note like "Already completed before template switch."

### Sequence Mode Questions

**Q: How do I know if a template is in strict or flexible mode?**
A: Look for lock icons (strict) or warning icons (flexible) on tasks.

**Q: Can I request a template be changed to flexible mode?**
A: Yes, ask your manager. They can update template settings.

**Q: In flexible mode, should I still follow sequence?**
A: Yes, when possible. The sequence is recommended for a reason. Only deviate when necessary.

**Q: What happens if I complete tasks out of order in strict mode?**
A: You can't. The system prevents it. Complete previous tasks first.

### Product Handling Questions

**Q: What if the serial number doesn't match the system?**
A: Stop work immediately and notify reception/manager. Do not proceed.

**Q: Where can I find a product's serial number?**
A: Check device back/bottom, settings menu, SIM tray, or original packaging.

**Q: What if there's no serial number?**
A: Report to manager. Some products may need manual serial number creation/documentation.

**Q: Do I need to track warehouse movements?**
A: No, the system tracks automatically based on task completion and ticket status.

### Comments Questions

**Q: When should I use internal vs external comments?**
A: Internal for technical details and team communication. External only for customer-facing updates.

**Q: Can customers see my completion notes?**
A: No, completion notes are internal. Only comments marked "External" are visible to customers.

**Q: How many photos can I attach?**
A: Typically 5-10 per comment. Check with your manager if you need to attach more.

**Q: Can I delete a comment after posting?**
A: No, comments are permanent for audit purposes. Be careful what you write.
