## 📝 Previous Day's Accomplishments (2025-10-23)

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
1. **Fixed: Template Editor Not Loading Existing Data**
   - **Problem:** When clicking "Edit" on existing template, modal showed empty form
   - **Root Cause:** Missing tRPC procedure to fetch single template, missing hook, no data loading effect
   - **Solution:**
     - Added `template.getById` procedure to workflow router
     - Created `useTaskTemplate(templateId)` hook
     - Updated TemplateEditorModal to load data when templateId provided
   - **Files Changed:**
     - `src/server/routers/workflow.ts` (added getById procedure)
     - `src/hooks/use-workflow.ts` (added useTaskTemplate hook)
     - `src/components/modals/template-editor-modal.tsx` (added data loading)

2. **Fixed: Next.js Hot Reload Broken**
   - **Problem:** Dev server returning 500 errors, corrupted build manifest files
   - **Root Cause:** Corrupted `.next` cache from rapid file changes
   - **Solution:**
     - Killed all dev server processes
     - Removed `.next` directory
     - Restarted fresh dev server
   - **Status:** ✅ Hot reload working correctly

### 🎯 Progress Made
