## Quick Extraction Guide

The original monolithic architecture document is still available at `docs/architecture.md` (now replaced with index).

To complete the sharding, you can:

### Option 1: Manual Extraction

Extract each section from the original document and create shard files with added diagrams:

**Section 2: Technology Stack** (`02-technology-stack.md`)
- Add decision tree diagram for technology choices
- Add technology stack layers diagram
- Include comparison tables

**Section 3: Data Models** (`03-data-models.md`)
- Existing ER diagram
- Add schema dependency flow diagram
- Add trigger sequence diagram
- Add RLS policy visualization

**Section 5: API Design** (`05-api-design.md`)
- Add API router hierarchy diagram
- Add request/response flow diagram
- Add type inference flow diagram

**Section 6: Source Tree** (`06-source-tree.md`)
- Add directory tree visualization
- Add import resolution diagram

**Section 7: Infrastructure** (`07-infrastructure.md`)
- Add multi-tenant architecture diagram
- Add Docker services diagram
- Add deployment flow diagram
- Add port allocation diagram

**Section 8: Coding Standards** (`08-coding-standards.md`)
- Add standards enforcement flow
- Add naming convention examples

**Section 9: Testing Strategy** (`09-testing-strategy.md`)
- Add testing pyramid diagram
- Add test coverage matrix
- Add phased implementation timeline

**Section 10: Security** (`10-security.md`)
- Existing 4-layer security diagram
- Add authentication sequence diagram
- Add RLS enforcement flow
- Add threat model diagram

### Option 2: Use the Monolithic Version

The complete architecture documentation exists as a single file backup. You can reference sections 2, 3, 5-10 from there and split them into individual files.

## Diagram Templates

### Mermaid Diagram Types Used

```markdown
# Flow Diagram
​```mermaid
graph TB
    A[Start] --> B[Process]
    B --> C[End]
​```

# Sequence Diagram
​```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant A
    participant B
    A->>B: Request
    B-->>A: Response
​```

# ER Diagram
​```mermaid
erDiagram
    TABLE1 ||--o{ TABLE2 : has
​```

# Mind Map
​```mermaid
mindmap
  root((Topic))
    Subtopic1
    Subtopic2
​```

# Timeline
​```mermaid
timeline
    title Evolution
    2024 : Event1
    2025 : Event2
​```
```

## Shard Template

Each shard should follow this structure:

```markdown
# N. Section Title

[← Previous: ...](XX-previous.md) | [Back to Index](../architecture.md) | [Next: ... →](XX-next.md)

---

## N.1 Subsection

Content with diagrams...

### N.1.1 Detail

More content...

## N.2 Subsection

...

---

## Next Steps

Continue to [Next Section →](XX-next.md) to...

---

[← Previous: ...](XX-previous.md) | [Back to Index](../architecture.md) | [Next: ... →](XX-next.md)
```

## Navigation Links

Each shard should include:
- Header navigation: `← Previous | Back to Index | Next →`
- Footer navigation: Same as header
- "Next Steps" section pointing to next shard

## Completion Checklist

When creating each shard:
- [ ] Extract content from monolithic document
- [ ] Add appropriate Mermaid diagrams (minimum 2-3 per shard)
- [ ] Add navigation links (header and footer)
- [ ] Add "Next Steps" section
- [ ] Verify internal links work
- [ ] Update main index if needed
- [ ] Ensure consistent formatting
- [ ] Add status indicators (✅ 🟡 ⏳ etc.)

## Benefits of Sharding

1. **Maintainability** - Easier to update specific sections
2. **Readability** - Smaller, focused documents
3. **Performance** - Faster page loads for viewers
4. **Navigation** - Clear structure and linking
5. **Collaboration** - Multiple people can work on different sections
6. **Version Control** - Better git diffs and merge conflicts
