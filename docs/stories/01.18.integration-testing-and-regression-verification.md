# Story 1.18: Integration Testing and Regression Verification

**Epic:** EPIC-01 - Service Center Phase 2 - Workflow, Warranty & Warehouse
**Story ID:** SC-PHASE2-01.18
**Created:** 2025-10-23
**Status:** Draft
**Depends On:** Stories 1.1-1.17 (All previous stories)

---

## Story

**As a** QA engineer,
**I want** comprehensive integration testing to verify all Phase 2 features work together without breaking existing functionality,
**so that** we can deploy to production with confidence.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Test all Integration Verification (IV) criteria from Stories 1.1-1.17
2. End-to-end testing: Customer submits request → Staff converts → Tasks executed → Delivery confirmed → Email sent
3. Regression testing: All existing features from Phase 1 still function
4. Performance testing: Verify NFR1 (15% latency threshold), NFR5 (99% uptime)
5. Database integrity: Foreign keys, constraints, triggers all working
6. RLS policy verification: Test all roles (Admin, Manager, Technician, Reception)
7. Public portal security: Rate limiting, no data leakage, token validation
8. Multi-user concurrency: Multiple technicians working on different tickets simultaneously
9. Data migration testing: Verify existing tickets/customers unaffected
10. Create test plan document with pass/fail criteria

---

## Integration Verification

- **IV1**: All previous IV criteria (IV1-IV4 from Stories 1.1-1.17) pass
- **IV2**: No regression in existing Phase 1 features
- **IV3**: Performance meets NFR requirements
- **IV4**: Security policies enforced correctly

## Dev Notes

**Test Scenarios:**
- E2E Flow: Public request → Staff conversion → Task execution → Delivery → Email
- Regression: Ticket CRUD, Parts inventory, Customer management
- Performance: Load 100 active tickets, measure response times
- Security: Role-based access, rate limiting, SQL injection prevention
- Concurrency: 5 technicians completing tasks simultaneously

**Testing Standards:** Follow `docs/architecture/09-testing-strategy.md`

**Testing:** Manual testing, automated testing where feasible
